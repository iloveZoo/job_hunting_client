          'Here\'s a basic implementation of the Snake game in Python using the `pygame` library. I\'ll explain each step as we go along.\nFirst, make sure you have `pygame` installed.

We import the necessary modules, `pygame` for graphics and `random` for generating random food positions.\n2. We initialize `pygame` and set up the display window.\n3. We define some colors that we\'ll use for the game elements.\n4. We set the initial position and properties of the snake and the food.\n5. We define functions to draw the snake, draw the food, display a message, and handle game over conditions.\n6. The main game loop runs continuously until the game is quit.\n   - It checks for events like key presses and the close button being clicked.\n   - It updates the snake\'s direction based on arrow key presses.\n   - It moves the snake and updates its position.\n   - It checks for collisions with itself and the walls, and ends the game if a collision occurs.\n   - It removes the last segment of the snake\'s body and updates its position.\n   - It spawns food if it\'s not already spawned.\n   - It checks if the snake ate the food and updates the score accordingly.\n   - It draws the snake, food, and score on the screen.\n   - It controls the game speed using the clock.\nThis is a basic implementation of the Snake game.
